                        <h4>Early Life</h4>
                    <p>Louis Armstrong was born on August 4, 1901, in New Orleans, Louisiana, in a neighborhood so poor that it was nicknamed "The Battlefield."</p>
                    <p>Armstrong had a difficult childhood: His father was a factory worker and abandoned the family soon after Louis's birth. His mother,
                         who often turned to prostitution, frequently left him with his maternal grandmother. Armstrong was obligated to leave school in the
                          fifth grade to begin working.</p>
                    <p>A local Jewish family, the Karnofskys, gave young Armstrong a job collecting junk and delivering coal. 
                        They also encouraged him to sing and often invited him into their home for meals.</p>
                    <p>On New Year's Eve in 1912, Armstrong fired his stepfather's gun in the air during a New Year's Eve 
                        celebration and was arrested on the spot. He was then sent to the Colored Waif's Home for Boys.</p>
                    <p>There, he received musical instruction on the cornet and fell in love with music.
                         In 1914, the home released him, and he immediately began dreaming of a life making music.</p>

                        <p>While he still had to work odd jobs selling newspapers and hauling coal to the city's 
                            famed red-light district, Armstrong began earning a reputation as a fine blues player.</p>
                        <p>One of the greatest cornet players in town, Joe "King" Oliver, began acting as a mentor to the young Armstrong, 
                            showing him pointers on the horn and occasionally using him as a sub.</p>

                        <p>By the end of his teens, Armstrong had grown up fast. In 1918, he married Daisy Parker,
                             a prostitute, commencing a stormy union marked by many arguments and acts of violence. </p>
                        <p>During this time, Armstrong adopted a three-year-old boy named Clarence. The boy's mother, Armstrong's cousin, had died in childbirth. Clarence, 
                            who had become mentally disabled from a head injury he had suffered at an early age, was taken care of by Armstrong his entire life.</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile, Armstrong's reputation as a musician continued to grow: In 1918, 
                            he replaced Oliver in Kid Ory's band, then the most popular band in New Orleans.</p>
                        <p>He was soon able to stop working manual labor jobs and began concentrating full-time on his cornet, 
                            playing parties, dances, funeral marches and at local "honky-tonks"—a name for small bars that typically host musical acts.</p> 
                        <p>Beginning in 1919, Armstrong spent his summers playing on riverboats with a band led by Fate Marable. It was on the riverboat that Armstrong 
                            honed his music reading skills and eventually had his first encounters with other jazz legends, including Bix Beiderbecke and Jack Teagarden.</p>
