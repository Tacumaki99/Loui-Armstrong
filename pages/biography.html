                    <h3>Early Life</h3>
                    <p>Louis Armstrong was born on August 4, 1901, in New Orleans, Louisiana, in a neighborhood so poor that it was nicknamed "The Battlefield."</p>
                    <p>Armstrong had a difficult childhood: His father was a factory worker and abandoned the family soon after Louis's birth. His mother,
                         who often turned to prostitution, frequently left him with his maternal grandmother. Armstrong was obligated to leave school in the
                          fifth grade to begin working.</p>
                    <p>A local Jewish family, the Karnofskys, gave young Armstrong a job collecting junk and delivering coal. 
                        They also encouraged him to sing and often invited him into their home for meals.</p>
                    <p>On New Year's Eve in 1912, Armstrong fired his stepfather's gun in the air during a New Year's Eve 
                        celebration and was arrested on the spot. He was then sent to the Colored Waif's Home for Boys.</p>
                    <p>There, he received musical instruction on the cornet and fell in love with music.
                         In 1914, the home released him, and he immediately began dreaming of a life making music.</p>
